## 👥 Who is this for?
- **Beginners:** If you're overwhelmed by conflicting advice and "bro-science."
- **Busy Professionals:** If you have limited time and need to know the most efficient path forward.
- **The "Stuck":** If you've been "training" but not seeing results because of hidden bottlenecks like poor sleep or lack of consistency.
- **Pragmatists:** Anyone tired of marketing fluff and "6-pack in 30 days" promises.

## ⏰ When to use it?
- **Starting Out:** Before you buy a gym membership or expensive supplements.
- **Hitting a Plateau:** When your progress stalls and you need to find the root cause.
- **Lifestyle Changes:** When your schedule changes (e.g., less sleep, less time) and you need to adjust your routine.
- **Reality Checks:** When you need a reminder of what actually matters in fitness.

## ⚙️ How it works?
The engine uses a deterministic **Rule-Based Analysis** system:
1. **Data Collection:** You input your age, weight, height, sleep, activity, time, and consistency patterns.
2. **BMI & Category:** It calculates your body metrics to understand your physical starting point.
3. **Bottleneck Identification:** It compares your goals against your lifestyle (e.g., "Muscle Gain" vs "5 hours of sleep").
4. **Logic Trace:** It runs your data through a series of "if-then" fitness principles (e.g., *If sleep < 6 hours, then High-Intensity Gym is high-risk*).
5. **Path Selection:** It determines which training styles (Gym, Home, HIIT, Walking) are currently safe and effective for you.
